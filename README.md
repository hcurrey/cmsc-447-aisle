## TODO

- Beautify this readme?
- CMSC 447 Group Project, a recipe query wrapper
- With this program the user will be able to search and read through recipes.
- The recipes will be given to the user through web scraping which looks for
- recipes with the desired ingredients.
- The recipes are then queried to find if the ingredients desired are in the
- recipes being looked at.
